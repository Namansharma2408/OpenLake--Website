          Open source refers to software that is made freely available for
          anyone to use, modify, and distribute. The term also extends to a
          broader philosophy of openness and collaboration. Unlike proprietary
          software, where the source code is kept secret and controlled by a
          single company, open source software shares its source code publicly,
          allowing developers worldwide to contribute to and improve the
          software.
          <br />
          <br />
          The open source movement gained momentum with projects like the Linux
          operating system, the Apache HTTP server, and many others. These
          projects demonstrated that communities of volunteers and professionals
          could produce high-quality software without restrictive licensing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Open source promotes transparency and security because anyone can
          inspect the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious code. It also
          encourages innovation, as developers can build on existing projects
          without needing to start from scratch. Moreover, open source empowers
          users to adapt the software to their specific needs, fostering
          flexibility and independence.
          <br />
          <br />
          Many companies today leverage open source software in their products
          and services, contributing to and benefiting from the shared
          ecosystem. The open source model also supports a vibrant community
          culture where individuals can collaborate, learn from one another, and
          drive technological progress.
